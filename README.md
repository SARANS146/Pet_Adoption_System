# Pet_Adoption_System
The Pet Adoption System is a simple database-driven application designed to manage pet records and check their adoption availability. The system retrieves pet details and displays whether a pet is available for adoption.

This project demonstrates database operations, data retrieval, and conditional logic implementation.
